# Sparnatural documentation

_For examples of how Sparnatural works and can be configured, have a look at the [**demos folder**](https://github.com/sparna-git/sparnatural.eu/tree/main/demos) of [sparnatural.eu](http://sparnatural.eu) website._


## 1. Features

- [Reference documentation of Sparnatural widgets](widgets.md) : all the possible ways to select a criteria value in Sparnatural. Read this to learn some of the features of Sparnatural.
- [Reference documentation of result display plugins](result-display.md) : the specific ways to display search results after a query has been written, beyond classical table display.

## 2. Getting started

- **[Hello Sparnatural](hello-sparnatural/Hello-Sparnatural.md)** : start here to integrate Sparnatural in your own website, from the tutorial page.


## 3. Configuring Sparnatural

### 3.1 SHACL configuration

Sparnatural is configured by a configuration file expressed in SHACL. The configuration file can be edited in an Excel spreadsheet.

- **[How-to configure in SHACL](how-to-configure-shacl/How-to-configure-Sparnatural-shacl.html)** : a detailled documentation for configuring Sparnatural in a spreadsheet. Start here to learn the different configuration options of Sparnatural.
- [Reference page of SHACL configuration](SHACL-based-configuration.md) : the list of all SHACL constructs Sparnatural understands

### 3.2 deprecated OWL configuration

Historically, Sparnatural also supported configuration specified in OWL :

- [How-to configure in OWL](how-to-configure-owl/How-to-configure-Sparnatural.md) : a detailled documentation for configuring Sparnatural in an OWL spreadsheet (that is converted into a OWL configuration file). This is deprecated and now replaced by the SHACL configuration guide.
- [Configure in OWL using Protégé](OWL-based-configuration.md) : a reference page of all useful OWL axioms and annotations to configure Sparnatural with OWL
- [Configure datasources in OWL](OWL-based-configuration-datasources.md) : a reference page of all included datasources and how-to write your own datasource
